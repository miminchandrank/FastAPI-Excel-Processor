# üìä FastAPI Excel Processor

This FastAPI project allows users to process an Excel file (`capbudg.xls`) and interact with its contents through a set of API endpoints. The application supports table listing, row extraction, and numerical summation for specified rows.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This API is built using **FastAPI** and is designed to:

1. **Read and parse** data from a given Excel file.
2. **Expose API endpoints** to list tables, show row details, and compute row-wise numerical sums.

Base URL: `http://localhost:9090`



Run the API server
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9090

‚úÖ GET /list_tables
Returns the names of all sheets (treated as "tables") in the Excel file.
Response:

{
  "tables": [
    "Initial Investment",
    "Revenue Projections",
    "Operating Expenses"
  ]
}

‚úÖ GET /get_table_details?table_name={name}
Returns the list of row names (first column values) from a given sheet.

Example Request:
GET /get_table_details?table_name=Initial Investment
Response:

{
  "table_name": "Initial Investment",
  "row_names": [
    "Initial Investment=",
    "Opportunity cost (if any)=",
    "Lifetime of the investment",
    "Salvage Value at end of project=",
    "Deprec. method(1:St.line;2:DDB)=",
    "Tax Credit (if any )=",
    "Other invest.(non-depreciable)="
  ]
}

‚úÖ GET /row_sum?table_name={name}&row_name={row}
Calculates and returns the sum of all numeric values in the given row.

Example Request:
GET /row_sum?table_name=Initial Investment&row_name=Tax Credit (if any )=

Response:
{
  "table_name": "Initial Investment",
  "row_name": "Tax Credit (if any )=",
